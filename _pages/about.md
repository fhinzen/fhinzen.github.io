<p><b>Job Market Paper</b><br>
<em>Nonbank Market Power in Leveraged Lending</em><br>
Banks rely on loan sales to nonbank investors to finance lending to
risky borrowers. Among those investors, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)
provide the bulk of funds. For this investor class, I show that firm-nonbank
funding is highly persistent over time. This persistence exists even absent firmbank
relationships. Rather arranging banks face switching costs among CLO
investors which can yield market power to CLOs during loan origination. To
disentangle the effects of market power from those of institutional demand, I
employ variation in CLO managersâ€™ loan portfolios stemming from mergers.
I provide evidence that CLO market power leads to banks accepting higher
spreads for their borrowers.</p>
