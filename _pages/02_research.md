<b>Nonbank Market Power in Leveraged Lending</b><br>
<a href='/assets/pdf/JMP_Hinzen_NonbankMarketPower.pdf'><u>Draft</u></a>

<p align="justify"><em>Abstract:</em> Banks rely on loan sales to nonbank investors to finance lending to risky borrowers. Among those investors, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) provide the bulk of funds. I show that CLOs have market power during origination that leads banks to accept higher spreads for their borrowers. To identify the effects of market power, I employ variation in CLO managers’ loan portfolios stemming from mergers. To this end, I provide evidence that CLO liabilities are the main merger determinants. CLO market power is a result of switching costs faced by the arranging bank as evident by a high degree of persistence in firm-nonbank funding. This persistence exists even absent firm-bank relationships. Rather, switching costs arise as a result of information asymmetries across CLO managers that the bank is unable to resolve.</p>

<b>Bitcoin's Limited Adoption Problem</b><br>

<p align="justify"><em>Abstract:</em> We demonstrate theoretically that Bitcoin’s limited adoption arises as an equilibrium outcome rather than as a short-lived property. Our results are driven by negative network effects which arise due to Bitcoin’s need for consensus and the existence of network delay. As the Bitcoin network expands, network delay grows thereby prolonging the time needed for generating consensus. In turn, transaction settlement becomes prolonged, and users abandon the system, yielding limited adoption. Increasing transaction rates fails to solve this problem because increasing transaction rates increases fork probabilities which prolongs the consensus process and generates limited adoption.</p>
