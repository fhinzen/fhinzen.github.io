<b>Nonbank Market Power in Leveraged Lending</b><br>
<a href='/assets/pdf/JMP_Hinzen_NonbankMarketPower.pdf'><u>Draft</u></a>

<p align="justify"><em>Abstract:</em> Banks rely on loan sales to nonbank investors to finance lending to risky borrowers. Among those investors, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) provide the bulk of funds. For this investor class, I show that firm-nonbank funding is highly persistent over time. This persistence exists even absent firmbank relationships. Rather arranging banks face switching costs among CLO investors which can yield market power to CLOs during loan origination. To disentangle the effects of market power from those of institutional demand, I employ variation in CLO managers’ loan portfolios stemming from mergers. I provide evidence that CLO market power leads to banks accepting higher spreads for their borrowers.</p>

<b>Bitcoin's Limited Adoption Problem</b><br>

<p align="justify"><em>Abstract:</em> We demonstrate theoretically that Bitcoin’s limited adoption arises as an equilibrium outcome rather than as a short-lived property. Our results are driven by negative network effects which arise due to Bitcoin’s need for consensus and the existence of network delay. As the Bitcoin network expands, network delay grows thereby prolonging the time needed for generating consensus. In turn, transaction settlement becomes prolonged, and users abandon the system, yielding limited adoption. Increasing transaction rates fails to solve this problem because increasing transaction rates increases fork probabilities which prolongs the consensus process and generates limited adoption.</p>
